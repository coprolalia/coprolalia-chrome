Coprolalia is involuntary swearing or the involuntary utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks. (From Wikipedia)

After you install coprolalia it will bluntly insert swearwords into the text of the web pages you visit. No clicking or anything required. Works well only on English web pages.

This is the source code repository for the Extension. Add the current release to Chrome from https://github.com/coprolalia/coprolalia-chrome/releases
